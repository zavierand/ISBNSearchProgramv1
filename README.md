# ISBNSearchProgramv1


This is an ISBN ID search program created with C++. The goal of this project was to create a program that takes and stores data from a text file (compscibooks.txt) using the #include <fstream> header and store that data in sorted arrays. From there, the user can input their desired selections based off what options the menu gives them.

Users were given different options to dsplay what information they wanted to see - printing textbook names, different textbook editions, or looking up a textbook by inputting the ISBN or ASIN number of said textbook. 

The algorithm practiced in this project was linear search and the concept of function overloading (linear search algorithms taking in different array types as parameters).
  
A second version of this program is in the works to work on implementing classes and the use of dynamic memory allocation with pointers.
